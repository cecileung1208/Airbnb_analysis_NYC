![Image](https://www.newyorkhotels.org//img_new/top_banner2.png)

## Background

The purpose of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of the New York City Airbnb listings in 2021.  We have identified key trends and characteristics for each borough.  Then, interactive maps are created to determine room-type rates for each neighbourhoodand and the locations of all the listings.  To do this, We must obtain datasets from external sources, perform an analysis by using HTML, Javascript, Plotly, and Leaflet to display interactive visualizations and deploy it in the Heroku web application.

## Questions

1.  What are the different types of properties in NYC?
2.  Does property type availability vary by neighbourhood?
3.  What neighbourhoods in NYC are rated highly by guests?
4.  How do prices of listings vary by location?
5.  How has the demand for Airbnb rentals evolved from over time?

The marker cluster map shows the number of listing within the different boroughs and neighbourhoods in New York City.  As you zoom in the map, the number circle spreads out and you will see blue markers where the exact listing is locating.  You can click on the blue marker and find the infomration of that specific listing.  You can even click on "More info" and it will direct you to the Airbnb link to that specific listing.
